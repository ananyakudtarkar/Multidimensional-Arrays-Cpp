Multidimensional Arrays and Matrix Operations in C++
Multidimensional arrays are a powerful tool in C++ for representing data structures like matrices. This document provides a theoretical overview and practical algorithms for common matrix operations.

Theory: What are Multidimensional Arrays?
A multidimensional array in C++ is essentially an array of arrays. The most common type is a two-dimensional array, which you can visualize as a grid with rows and columns. While C++ doesn't have a built-in "matrix" type, you can use these arrays to perform matrix-like operations.

Syntax:

C++

// Declaring a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns
data_type array_name[row_size][column_size];
int matrix[3][4];
Memory Layout:
C++ stores multidimensional arrays in a contiguous block of memory using a row-major order. This means the elements of the first row are stored sequentially, followed by the elements of the second row, and so on. You can access an individual element using array_name[row_index][column_index].

Matrix Operations
Here are the algorithms for several fundamental matrix operations, perfect for implementing in your C++ projects.

1. Matrix Addition
This operation adds two matrices of the same dimensions, element by element. If the dimensions don't match, addition is not possible.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a result matrix C with the same dimensions as the input matrices A and B.
2. Iterate through each row i from 0 to row_size - 1.
3. Inside the row loop, iterate through each column j from 0 to column_size - 1.
4. Calculate the sum of the corresponding elements: C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j].
5. After the loops complete, the C matrix will contain the sum of A and B.


2. Matrix Multiplication
To multiply matrix A (size m
timesn) by matrix B (size n
timesp), the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B. The resulting matrix C will have dimensions m
timesp.

Algorithm:
1. Check if the number of columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B. If not, the multiplication is not possible.
2. Initialize a result matrix C with dimensions m×p, with all elements set to 0.
3. Iterate through each row i of matrix A from 0 to m−1.
4. Inside the first loop, iterate through each column j of matrix B from 0 to p−1.
5. Inside the second loop, iterate through a third loop k from 0 to n−1.
6. In the innermost loop, update the element C[i][j] by adding the product of A[i][k] and B[k][j]. The formula is: C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j].
7. After all loops are complete, C holds the product of A and B.

3. Diagonal Addition
This operation applies only to a square matrix (where rows = columns). It calculates the sum of the elements along the main diagonal (where the row and column indices are the same).

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
2. Iterate through the matrix using a single loop, i, from 0 to size - 1.
3. In each iteration, add the element at matrix[i][i] to sum.
4. After the loop finishes, sum will contain the sum of the diagonal elements.


4. Matrix Transpose
The transpose of a matrix A (size m
timesn) is a new matrix A^T (size n
timesm), where the rows and columns are swapped. An element at A[i][j] becomes the element at A^T[j][i].

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a result matrix A_T with dimensions n×m.
2. Iterate through each row i of the original matrix A from 0 to m−1.
3. Inside the first loop, iterate through each column j of A from 0 to n−1.
4. Assign the value of A[i][j] to A_T[j][i].
5. After the loops, A_T will be the transpose of A.
